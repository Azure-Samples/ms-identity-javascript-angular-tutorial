## Overview

This sample demonstrates how to deploy an Angular single-page application (SPA) coupled with a .NET Core web API to **Azure Cloud** using [Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/) and [Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/), respectively. To do so, we will use the [same code sample from Chapter 3](../3-Authorization-II/1-call-api).

> :information_source: You may also choose to deploy the [B2C sample from Chapter 3](../3-Authorization-II/2-call-api-b2c/README.md) instead. Steps below are more or less the same.

## Scenario

1. The client application uses **MSAL Angular** to sign-in a user and obtain a JWT **Access Token** from **Azure AD**.
1. The **Access Token** is used as a **bearer** token to *authorize* the user to call the protected web API.
1. The protected web API responds with the claims in the **Access Token**.

## Prerequisites

- An **Azure subscription**. This sample uses **Azure Storage** and **Azure App Service**.

## Registration

### Register the service app (.NET Core web API)

Use the same app registration credentials that you've obtained during [**chapter 3-1**](../3-Authorization-II/1-call-api/README.md#registration). Update your project files here as needed.

### Register the client app (Angular SPA)

Use the same app registration credentials that you've obtained during [**chapter 3-1**](../3-Authorization-II/1-call-api/README.md#registration). Update your project files here as needed.

## Deployment

### Deploying web API to Azure App Services

There is one .NET Core web API in this sample. To deploy it to **Azure App Services**, you'll need to:

- create an **Azure App Service**
- publish the projects to the **App Services**

#### Publish your files

1. Sign-in to **App Service** using an Azure AD Account.
1. Open the `API` project folder.
1. Choose **View** > **Terminal** from the main menu.
1. The terminal opens in the `API` folder.
1. Run the following command:

    ```console
    dotnet publish --configuration Release
    ```

1. Publish folder is created under path `bin/Release/<Enter_Framework_FolderName>`.
1. Right-click on **Publish** folder and select **Deploy to Web App**.
1. Select **Create New Web App**, enter a unique name for the app.
1. Select **Windows** as the OS. Press **Enter**.

#### Disable Azure App Services default authentication

1. Go to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and locate your project there.
    - On the Settings tab, select **Authentication/Authorization**. Make sure `App Service Authentication` is Off. Select **Save**.
1. Browse your website. If you see the default web page of the project, the publication was successful.

#### Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)

1. Go to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and locate your project there.
    - On the API tab, select **CORS**. Check the box **Enable Access-Control-Allow-Credentials**.
    - Under **Allowed origins**, add the coordinates of your published website.

### Deploying SPA to Azure Storage

There is one Angular single-page application in this sample. To deploy it to **Azure Storage**, you'll need to:

- create an Azure Storage blob and obtain website coordinates
- build your project and upload it to Azure Storage blob
- update config files with website coordinates

> :information_source: If you would like to use **VS Code Azure Tools** extension for deployment, [watch the tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/javascript/tutorial-vscode-static-website-node-01) offered by Microsoft Docs.

#### Build and upload the Angular SPA to an Azure Storage blob

Build your project to get a distributable files folder, where your built `html`, `css` and `javascript` files will be generated.

```console
    cd SPA
    ng build --prod
```

Then follow the steps below:

> :warning: When uploading, make sure you upload the contents of your distributable files folder and **not** the entire folder itself.

> :information_source: If you don't have an account already, see: [How to create a storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create).

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Locate your storage account and display the account overview.
1. Select **Static website** to display the configuration page for static websites.
1. Select **Enabled** to enable static website hosting for the storage account.
1. In the **Index document name** field, specify a default index page (For example: `index.html`).
1. The default **index page** is displayed when a user navigates to the root of your static website.
1. Select **Save**. The Azure portal now displays your static website endpoint. Make a note of the **Primary endpoint field**.
1. Next, select **Storage Explorer**.
1. Expand the **BLOB CONTAINERS** node, and then select the `$web` container.
1. Choose the **Upload** button to upload files.
1. If you intend for the browser to display the contents of file, make sure that the content type of that file is set to `text/html`.
1. In the pane that appears beside the **account overview page** of your storage account, select **Static Website**. The URL of your site appears in the **Primary endpoint field**. In the next section, you will register this URI.

##### Update the Azure AD app registration

1. Navigate back to to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations**.
1. In the resulting screen, select `msal-angular-spa`.
1. In the app's registration screen, select **Authentication** in the menu.
   - In the **Redirect URIs** section, update the reply URLs to match the site URL of your Azure deployment. For example:
      - `https://angularspa1.z22.web.core.windows.net`

### Update authentication configuration parameters

1. In your IDE, locate the `SPA` project. Then, open `SPA\src\app\auth-config.ts`.
2. Find the key for **redirect URI** and replace its value with the address of the web app you published, for example, `https://angularspa1.z22.web.core.windows.net`.
3. Find the key for **web API endpoint** and replace its value with the address of the web API you published, for example, `https://dotnetwebapi.azurewebsites.net/api/todolist`.

## Explore the sample

1. Open your browser and navigate to your deployed client app's URI, for instance: `https://angularspa1.z22.web.core.windows.net/`.
2. Select the **Sign In** button on the top right corner.
3. Select the **TodoList** button on the navigation bar to access your todo list.
