# Angular single-page application authorizing &#46;NET Core web API to call Microsoft Graph using on-behalf-of flow

[![Build status](https://identitydivision.visualstudio.com/IDDP/_apis/build/status/AAD%20Samples/.NET%20client%20samples/ASP.NET%20Core%20Web%20App%20tutorial)](https://identitydivision.visualstudio.com/IDDP/_build/latest?definitionId=819)
## Scenario

1. The client Angular SPA uses the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to sign-in and obtain a JWT access token from **Azure AD**.
2. The access token is used as a *bearer* token to authorize the user to call the .NET Core web API protected by **Azure AD**.
## Prerequisites

- Either [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started)

- An **Azure AD** tenant. For more information, see: [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant)
- A user account in your **Azure AD** tenant. This sample will not work with a **personal Microsoft account**.  If you're signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a personal Microsoft account and have not created a user account in your directory before, you will need to create one before proceeding.
## How to run this sample
### Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-angular-tutorial.git
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> :warning: To avoid path length limitations on Windows, we recommend cloning into a directory near the root of your drive.

### Step 2: Install project dependencies

```console
    dotnet restore
```

```console
    dotnet restore
```

### Registration

There are two projects in this sample. Each needs to be separately registered in your Azure AD tenant. To register these projects, you can:

- follow the steps below for manually register your apps
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the projects' configuration files.

  <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

> :warning: If you have never used **Azure AD Powershell** before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.

1. On Windows, run PowerShell as **Administrator** and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. If you have never used Azure AD Powershell before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   cd .\AppCreationScripts\
   .\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)
   > The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

</details>

### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

### Register the service app (ProfileAPI)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `ProfileAPI`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Certificates & secrets** blade in the left to open the page where you can generate secrets and upload certificates.
1. In the **Client secrets** section, select **New client secret**:
   - Type a key description (for instance `app secret`),
   - Select one of the available key durations (**6 months**, **12 months** or **Custom**) as per your security posture.
   - The generated key value will be displayed when you select the **Add** button. Copy and save the generated value for use in later steps.
   - You'll need this key later in your code's configuration files. This key value will not be displayed again, and is not retrievable by any other means, so make sure to note it from the Azure portal before navigating to any other screen or blade.
    > :bulb: For enhanced security, consider [using certificates](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web/wiki/Certificates) instead of client secrets.

   1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
      - Select the **Add a permission** button and then,
      - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected.
      - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, select **Microsoft Graph**
      - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **User.Read**, **offline_access** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
      - Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Expose an API** blade to the left to open the page where you can declare the parameters to expose this app as an API for which client applications can obtain [access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) for.
The first thing that we need to do is to declare the unique [resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) URI that the clients will be using to obtain access tokens for this API. To declare an resource URI, follow the following steps:
   - Select `Set` next to the **Application ID URI** to generate a URI that is unique for this app.
   - For this sample, accept the proposed Application ID URI (`api://{clientId}`) by selecting **Save**.
1. All APIs have to publish a minimum of one [scope](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code) for the client's to obtain an access token successfully. To publish a scope, follow these steps:
   - Select **Add a scope** button open the **Add a scope** screen and Enter the values as indicated below:
        - For **Scope name**, use `access_as_user`.
        - Select **Admins and users** options for **Who can consent?**.
        - For **Admin consent display name** type `Access ProfileAPI`.
        - For **Admin consent description** type `Allows the app to access ProfileAPI as the signed-in user.`
        - For **User consent display name** type `Access ProfileAPI`.
        - For **User consent description** type `Allow the application to access ProfileAPI on your behalf.`
        - Keep **State** as **Enabled**.
        - Select the **Add scope** button on the bottom to save this scope.
1. Select the `Manifest` blade on the left.
   - Set `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` property to **2**.
   - Click on **Save**.

#### Configure the service app (ProfileAPI) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `API\ProfileAPI\appsettings.json` file.
1. Find the key `Domain` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant name.
1. Find the key `ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `ProfileAPI` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `ClientSecret` and replace the existing value with the key you saved during the creation of `ProfileAPI` copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `TenantId` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.

### Register the spa app (ProfileSPA)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `ProfileSPA`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
   - In the **Redirect URI (optional)** section, select **Single-page application** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URI: `http://localhost:4200`.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.

   1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
      - Select the **Add a permission** button and then:

      - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected.
      - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, select **Microsoft Graph**
      - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **User.Read** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
      - Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.
      - Select the **Add a permission** button and then:

      - Ensure that the **My APIs** tab is selected.
      - In the list of APIs, select the API `ProfileAPI`.
      - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **Access 'ProfileAPI'** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
      - Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.

#### Configure the spa app (ProfileSPA) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `SPA\src\app\auth-config.ts` file.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `ProfileSPA` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Application_Id_of_Service_Here` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `ProfileAPI` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Redirect_Uri_Here` and replace the existing value with Spa.

#### Configure Known Client Applications for service (ProfileAPI)

For a middle-tier web API (`ProfileAPI`) to be able to call a downstream web API, the middle tier app needs to be granted the required permissions as well. However, since the middle-tier cannot interact with the signed-in user, it needs to be explicitly bound to the client app in its **Azure AD** registration. This binding merges the permissions required by both the client and the middle-tier web API and presents it to the end user in a single consent dialog. The user then consent to this combined set of permissions.

To achieve this, you need to add the **Application Id** of the client app to the `knownClientApplications` property in the **manifest** of the web API. Here's how:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your `ProfileAPI` app registration, and select the **Manifest** blade.
1. In the manifest editor, change the `"knownClientApplications": []` line so that the array contains the Client ID of the client application (`ProfileSPA`) as an element of the array.

For instance:

```json
    "knownClientApplications": ["ca8dca8d-f828-4f08-82f5-325e1a1c6428"],
```

1. **Save** the changes to the manifest.

## Running the sample

> For Visual Studio Users
>
> Clean the solution, rebuild the solution, and run it.  You might want to go into the solution properties and set both projects as startup projects, with the service project starting first.

```console
    cd ProfileAPI
    dotnet run
```

```console
    cd ProfileSPA
    dotnet run
```


## Troubleshooting

 known issue on iOS 12
 ASP.NET core applications create session cookies that represent the identity of the caller. Some Safari users using iOS 12 had issues which are described in ASP.NET Core #4467 and the Web kit bugs database Bug 188165 - iOS 12 Safari breaks ASP.NET Core 2.1 OIDC authentication.

 If your web site needs to be accessed from users using iOS 12, you probably want to disable the SameSite protection, but also ensure that state changes are protected with CSRF anti-forgery mechanism. See the how to fix section of Microsoft Security Advisory: iOS12 breaks social, WSFed and OIDC logins #4647
