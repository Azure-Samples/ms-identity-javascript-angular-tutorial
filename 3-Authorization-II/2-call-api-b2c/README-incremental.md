## Overview

This sample demonstrates an Angular single-page application (SPA) calling a ASP.NET Core web API secured with [Azure AD B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview) using the [Microsoft Authentication Library for Angular](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-angular) (MSAL Angular) for the SPA and the [Microsoft.Identity.Web](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web) (M.I.W) for the web API.

## Scenario

1. The client Angular SPA uses **MSAL Angular** to sign-in and obtain a JWT access token from **Azure AD B2C**.
2. The access token is used as a bearer token to authorize the user to call the .NET Core web API protected by **Azure AD B2C**.

### Registration

:warning: This sample comes with a pre-registered application for demo purposes. If you would like to use your own **Azure AD B2C** tenant and application, follow the steps below to register and configure the application on **Azure portal**. Otherwise, continue with the steps for [Running the sample](#running-the-sample).

### Create User Flows and Custom Policies

Please refer to: [Tutorial: Create user flows in Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-user-flows)

### Add External Identity Providers

Please refer to: [Tutorial: Add identity providers to your applications in Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-add-identity-providers)

### Register the service app (msal-dotnet-api)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD B2C** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `msal-dotnet-api`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any identity provider or organizational directory (for authenticating users with user flows)**.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Expose an API** blade to the left to open the page where you can declare the parameters to expose this app as an API for which client applications can obtain [access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) for.
The first thing that we need to do is to declare the unique [resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) URI that the clients will be using to obtain access tokens for this Api. To declare an resource URI, follow the following steps:
   - Select `Set` next to the **Application ID URI** to generate a URI that is unique for this app.
   - For this sample, accept the proposed Application ID URI (`https://{tenantName}.onmicrosoft.com/{clientId}`) by selecting **Save**.
1. All APIs have to publish a minimum of one [scope](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code) for the client's to obtain an access token successfully. To publish a scope, follow the following steps:
   - Select **Add a scope** button open the **Add a scope** screen and Enter the values as indicated below:
        - For **Scope name**, use `access_as_user`.
        - For **Admin consent display name** type `Access msal-dotnet-api`.
        - For **Admin consent description** type `Allows the app to access msal-dotnet-api as the signed-in user.`
        - Keep **State** as **Enabled**.
        - Select the **Add scope** button on the bottom to save this scope.
1. On the right side menu, select the `Manifest` blade.
   - Set `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` property to **2**.
   - Click on **Save**.

#### Configure the service app (msal-dotnet-api) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `API\appsettings.json` file.
1. Find the key `Instance` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD B2C tenant name.
1. Find the key `ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `msal-dotnet-api` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `Domain` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD B2C tenant name.

1. Find the key `SignUpSignInPolicyId` and replace the existing value with your sign-up/sign-in user-flow string e.g. `b2c_1_susi`.
1. Find the key `EditProfilePolicyId` and replace the existing value with your profile-edit user-flow string e.g. `b2c_1_edit`.

1. Open the `API\Controllers\TodoListController.cs` file.
1. Find the variable `scopeRequiredByApi` and replace its value with the name of the API scope that you have just exposed (by default `demo.read`)

### Update the client app's registration (msal-angular-spa)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD B2C** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then find and select the application that you have registered in the previous tutorial (`msal-angular-spa`).
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `msal-angular-spa`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any identity provider or organizational directory (for authenticating users with user flows)**.
   - In the **Redirect URI (optional)** section, select **Single-page application** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URI: `http://localhost:4200/`.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
   - Select the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **My APIs** tab is selected.
   - In the list of APIs, select the API `msal-dotnet-api`.
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **Access 'msal-dotnet-api'** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.

#### Configure the client app (msal-angular-spa) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `SPA\src\app\auth-config.ts` file.
1. Find the key `clientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `msal-angular-spa` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `protectedResources.todoListApi.scopes` and replace the existing value with the scope of the web API that you have just exposed during the web API registration steps, for example `https://{tenantName}.onmicrosoft.com/{service_clientId}/access_as_user`

To setup your B2C user-flows, do the following:

1. Find the key `names` and populate it with your policy names e.g. `signUpSignIn`.
1. Find the key `authorities` and populate it with your policy authority strings e.g. `https://<your-tenant-name>.b2clogin.com/<your-tenant-name>.onmicrosoft.com/b2c_1_susi`.
1. Find the key `authorityDomain` and populate it with the domain portion of your authority string e.g. `<your-tenant-name>.b2clogin.com`.

## Running the sample

## About the code

### Access token validation

On the SPA side, clients should treat access tokens as opaque strings, as the contents of the token are intended for the resource only (such as a web API or Microsoft Graph). For validation and debugging purposes, developers can decode **JWT**s (*JSON Web Tokens*) using a site like [jwt.ms](https://jwt.ms).

On the web API side, token validation is handled by [Microsoft.Identity.Web](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web), using `JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme`. Simply initialize `AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApi()` with your configuration and add `AddAuthorization()` to the service;

```csharp
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            // Setting configuration for protected web api
            services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
                .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApi(Configuration);

            // Creating policies that wraps the authorization requirements
            services.AddAuthorization();
        }
```

In your controller, add [Authorize] decorator, which will make sure all incoming requests have an authentication bearer:

```csharp
    [Authorize]
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    public class TodoListController : ControllerBase
    {
        // The Web API will only accept tokens 1) for users, and 
        // 2) having the demo.read scope for this API
        static readonly string[] scopeRequiredByApi = new string[] { "demo.read" };

        private readonly TodoContext _context;

        public TodoListController(TodoContext context)
        {
            _context = context;
        }

        // GET: api/TodoItems
        [HttpGet]
        public async Task<ActionResult<IEnumerable<TodoItem>>> GetTodoItems()
        {
            HttpContext.VerifyUserHasAnyAcceptedScope(scopeRequiredByApi);
            string owner = User.FindFirst(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier)?.Value;
            return await _context.TodoItems.Where(item => item.Owner == owner).ToListAsync();
        }
        
        // ...
    }
```

### CORS configuration

You need to set **CORS** policy to be able to call the **TodoListAPI** in [Startup.cs](./API/Startup.cs). For the purpose of this sample, we are setting it to allow *any* domain and methods. In production, you should modify this to allow only the domains and methods you designate.

```csharp
    services.AddCors(o => o.AddPolicy("default", builder =>
    {
        builder.AllowAnyOrigin()
                .AllowAnyMethod()
                .AllowAnyHeader();
    }));
```
