## Overview

This sample demonstrates an Angular single-page application (SPA) calling a ASP.NET Core web API secured with [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) (Azure AD) using the [Microsoft Authentication Library for Angular](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-angular) (MSAL Angular) for the SPA and the [Microsoft.Identity.Web](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web) (M.I.W) for the web API.

## Scenario

1. The client Angular SPA uses **MSAL Angular** to sign-in and obtain a JWT access token from **Azure AD**.
2. The access token is used as a bearer token to authorize the user to call the .NET Core web API protected by **Azure AD**.

### Step 1. Install Angular SPA dependencies

```console
    cd ../
    cd SPA
    npm install
```

## Registration

### Register the sample applications with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There are two projects in this sample. Each needs to be separately registered in your Azure AD tenant. To register these projects, you can:

- either follow the steps below for manual registration,
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the configuration files.

<details>
  <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

1. On Windows, run PowerShell and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   cd .\AppCreationScripts\
   .\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)
   > The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

1. Follow the section on "Running the sample" below.

</details>

### Register the service app (msal-dotnet-api)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `msal-dotnet-api`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, click on the **Expose an API** blade to the left to open the page where you can declare the parameters to expose this app as an API for which client applications can obtain [access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) for.
The first thing that we need to do is to declare the unique [resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) URI that the clients will be using to obtain access tokens for this API. To declare an resource URI, follow the following steps:
   - Click `Set` next to the **Application ID URI** to generate a URI that is unique for this app.
   - For this sample, accept the proposed Application ID URI (api://{clientId}) by selecting **Save**.
1. All APIs have to publish a minimum of one [scope](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code) for the client's to obtain an access token successfully. To publish a scope, follow the following steps:
   - Select **Add a scope** button open the **Add a scope** screen and Enter the values as indicated below:
        - For **Scope name**, use `access_as_user`.
        - Select **Admins and users** options for **Who can consent?**
        - For **Admin consent display name** type `Access msal-dotnet-api`
        - For **Admin consent description** type `Allows the app to access msal-dotnet-api as the signed-in user.`
        - For **User consent display name** type `Access msal-dotnet-api`
        - For **User consent description** type `Allow the application to access msal-dotnet-api on your behalf.`
        - Keep **State** as **Enabled**
        - Click on the **Add scope** button on the bottom to save this scope.
1. On the right side menu, select the `Manifest` blade.
   - Set `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` property to **2**.
   - Click on **Save**.

#### Configure the service app (msal-dotnet-api) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE to configure the code.
>In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `API\appsettings.json` file.
1. Find the key `Domain` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant name.
1. Find the key `ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `msal-dotnet-api` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `TenantId` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.

1. Open the `API\Controllers\TodoListController.cs` file.
1. Find the variable `scopeRequiredByApi` and replace its value with the name of the API scope that you have just exposed (by default `access_as_user`).

### Update the client app's registration (msal-angular-spa)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then find and select the application that you have registered in the previous tutorial (`msal-angular-spa`).
1. In the app's registration screen, click on the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
   - Click the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **My APIs** tab is selected.
   - In the list of APIs, select the API `msal-dotnet-api`.
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **access_as_user** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Click on the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.

#### Configure the client app (msal-angular-spa) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE to configure the code.
>In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `SPA\src\app\auth-config.ts` file.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `msal-angular-spa` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Web_Api_Scope_here` and replace the existing value with *scope* you created earlier e.g. `api://{clientId_of_service_app}/access_as_user`.

## Run the sample

Using a command line interface such as VS Code integrated terminal, locate the application directory. Then:  

```console
    cd SPA
    npm start
```

In a separate console window, execute the following commands:

```console
    cd API
    dotnet run
```

## Explore the sample

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`.
2. Sign-in using the button on the top-right corner.
3. Select the **TodoList** button on the navigation bar to access your todo list.

## About the code

### Access token validation

On the SPA side, clients should treat access tokens as opaque strings, as the contents of the token are intended for the resource only (such as a web API or Microsoft Graph). For validation and debugging purposes, developers can decode **JWT**s (*JSON Web Tokens*) using a site like [jwt.ms](https://jwt.ms).

On the web API side, token validation is handled by [Microsoft.Identity.Web](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web), using `JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme`. Simply initialize `AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApi()` with your configuration and add `AddAuthorization()` to the service;

```csharp
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            // Setting configuration for protected web api
            services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
                .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApi(Configuration);

            // Creating policies that wraps the authorization requirements
            services.AddAuthorization();
        }
```

In your controller, add [Authorize] decorator, which will make sure all incoming requests have an authentication bearer:

```csharp
    [Authorize]
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    public class TodoListController : ControllerBase
    {
        // The Web API will only accept tokens 1) for users, and 
        // 2) having the access_as_user scope for this API
        static readonly string[] scopeRequiredByApi = new string[] { "access_as_user" };

        private readonly TodoContext _context;

        public TodoListController(TodoContext context)
        {
            _context = context;
        }

        // GET: api/TodoItems
        [HttpGet]
        public async Task<ActionResult<IEnumerable<TodoItem>>> GetTodoItems()
        {
            HttpContext.VerifyUserHasAnyAcceptedScope(scopeRequiredByApi);
            string owner = User.FindFirst(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier)?.Value;
            return await _context.TodoItems.Where(item => item.Owner == owner).ToListAsync();
        }
        
        // ...
    }
```

### CORS configuration

You need to set **CORS** policy to be able to call the **TodoListAPI** in [Startup.cs](./API/Startup.cs). For the purpose of this sample, we are setting it to allow *any* domain and methods. In production, you should modify this to allow only the domains and methods you designate.

```csharp
    services.AddCors(o => o.AddPolicy("default", builder =>
    {
        builder.AllowAnyOrigin()
                .AllowAnyMethod()
                .AllowAnyHeader();
    }));
```
